# NativeLib
These are the C source and build files for the Dyalog Native Library Samples. 

The Dyalog interpreter native library files **dwa_static** and **libdyalog** are required to build these projects. They are installed in **[DYALOG]/dwa/lib** in standard Dyalog installations from version 18.0 onwards. Therefore any software bulit from the Dyalog Native Library SDK (described in the document [*APL as a Shared Library*](http://docs.dyalog.com/latest/APL%20as%20a%20Shared%20Library.pdf)) must be used in accordance with a Dyalog license agreement.

## JSON_APL
This sample allows any language to call APL functions from any language which can access native shared libraries (using what is commonly referred to as the "Foreign Function Interface"), passing arguments and receiving results in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
