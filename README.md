# NativeLib
These are the C source and build files for the Dyalog Native Library Samples. 

The Dyalog interpreter native library files **dwa_static** and **libdyalog** are required to build these projects. They are installed in [DYALOG]/dwa/lib in standard Dyalog installations from version 18.0 onwards.

## JSON_APL
This sample allows any language to call APL functions from any language which can access native shared libraries (what is commonly referred to as the "Foreign Function Interface"), passing arguments and receiving results in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
